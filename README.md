# Dotfiles
![rice image](/src/rice.png)  
My arch dotfiles and shell script for deployment (see below).  

## Deployment
Use the following to install everything:  
```chmod +x deployment.sh```.  
```sh ./deployment.sh```.

**Be advised:**  
deployment.sh will create symlinks from `/git_workspace/deployment` to ```./config```, if you want to use another directory move the files to the right directories or manually edit the sh file.
