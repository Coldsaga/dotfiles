# dotfiles (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
My arch dotfiles.  
I don't get why people license their dotfiles, I don't think you can stop someone from using your public pro gamer settings.
**NOTE:** the PRIVATE folder is encrypted, you should just ignore it.

## Installation

I use gnu stow, it's handy, but if you don't want to, just manage it manually.  

**Using Stow**

- `sudo pacman -S git stow`
- `git clone https://github.com/GeladeiraTsunami/dotfiles`
- `-R README.md /private`
- `cd `_(dir)_
- `stow *`
